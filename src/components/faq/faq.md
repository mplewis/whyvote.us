# FAQ

## Where does your data come from?

Data comes from [Daily Kos Elections](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/11/25/1601042/-Nerd-Alert-This-spreadsheet-contains-every-presidential-election-by-state-from-1828-to-2016) and is available in [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D-edaVHTnZNhVU840EPUhz3Cgd7m39Urx7HM8Pq6Pus/edit#gid=29622862).

You can see the code I used to process this data into percentage margins in [this site's repo](https://github.com/mplewis/whyvote.us/tree/master/data).
