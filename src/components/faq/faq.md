# FAQ

## Where does your data come from?

Data comes from [Daily Kos Elections](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/11/25/1601042/-Nerd-Alert-This-spreadsheet-contains-every-presidential-election-by-state-from-1828-to-2016) and is available in [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D-edaVHTnZNhVU840EPUhz3Cgd7m39Urx7HM8Pq6Pus/edit#gid=29622862). You can see the code I used to process this data into percentage margins in [this site's repo](https://github.com/mplewis/whyvote.us/tree/master/data).

## Does my vote count?

If you don't live in a swing state, probably not.

If the collective voters of your state support one party with consistently high margins, it's not worth the time of a presidential candidate to try and flip your state. Candidates prefer to brawl over swing states that could easily go to either party.

Why would a Democrat spend time trying to flip Kansas (R +15-22%)? And why would a Republican try to score Rhode Island (D +17-38%)?

Both candidates can spend money more efficiently by campaigning in states like Florida (R +5% to D +6%) and Colorado (R +9% to D +9%). Swing states like these are more likely to flip either direction.

## Why didn't you include third-party candidates?

No Libertarian or Green Party candidate will ever win a presidential election because we use **first past the post** voting. With our current system, the only candidates that can win come from the Democrat and Republican parties.
