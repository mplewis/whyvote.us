# FAQ

## Does my vote count?

If you don't live in a swing state, your vote probably doesn't count.

If the collective voters of your state support one party with consistently high margins, it's not worth the time of a presidential candidate to try and flip your state. Candidates prefer to brawl over swing states that could easily go to either party.

Why would a Democrat spend time trying to flip **Kansas** (<span class="rep-red">R +15-22%</span>)? And why would a Republican try to score **Rhode Island** (<span class="dem-blu">D +17-38%</span>)?

Both candidates can spend money more efficiently by campaigning in states like **Florida** (<span class="rep-red">R +5%</span> to <span class="dem-blu">D +6%</span>) and **Colorado** (<span class="rep-red">R +9%</span> to <span class="dem-blu">D +9%</span>). Swing states like these are more likely to flip either direction.

## This sucks, right?

It sure does. In 2000, [Al Gore lost to George W. Bush](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/United_States_presidential_elections_in_which_the_winner_lost_the_popular_vote#/2000:_George_W._Bush) despite winning over 500,000 more votes. In 2016, [Hillary Clinton lost to Donald Trump](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/United_States_presidential_elections_in_which_the_winner_lost_the_popular_vote#/2016:_Donald_Trump) despite winning almost 3,000,000 more votes.

This isn't how democracy works.

## What can I do to change this?

**Call, fax, and write your state representatives.** Reaching out directly to your reps is one of the most effective ways to make your opinion heard in Washington.

**Text RESIST to 50409** or [message Resistbot on Messenger](http://m.me/resistbot/) and you can mail letters to Congress from the comfort of your phone. It's free and extremely easy.

**Register to vote. Then vote.** It's easy to forget to vote, and some states won't let you vote unless you're registered in advance. [Turbovote](https://turbovote.org/) is a very friendly tool that will help you get registered, stay registered, and remind you when your local elections are.

## Why didn't you include third-party candidates?

No Libertarian or Green Party candidate will ever win a presidential election because we use **first past the post** voting. With our current system, the only candidates that can win come from the Democrat and Republican parties.

## What counts as a **swing state**?

From [Wikipedia](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Swing_state):

> In American politics, the term swing state refers to any state that could reasonably be won by either the Democratic or Republican presidential candidate.

This site marks a state as a swing state if four or more recent elections were close.

## What counts as a **close** election?

This site defines close elections as ones where the Republican and Democrat votes are within 10 percentage points of each other.

## Where does your data come from?

Data comes from [Daily Kos Elections](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/11/25/1601042/-Nerd-Alert-This-spreadsheet-contains-every-presidential-election-by-state-from-1828-to-2016) and is available in [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D-edaVHTnZNhVU840EPUhz3Cgd7m39Urx7HM8Pq6Pus/edit#gid=29622862). You can see the code I used to process this data into percentage margins in [this site's repo](https://github.com/mplewis/whyvote.us/tree/master/data).
